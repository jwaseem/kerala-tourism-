                    Kollam About this soundpronunciation known by its former name Quilon
                    About this soundpronunciation and Coulão (in Portuguese), and Desinganadu, is an old
                    seaport and city on the Laccadive Sea coast of the Indian state of Kerala. It is situated 66
                    kilometers north of the state capital Trivandrum.The city is on the banks of Ashtamudi
                    Lake. Kollam has a strong commercial reputation since the days of the Phoenicians and
                    Romans. Fed by the Chinese trade, it was mentioned by Ibn Battuta in the 14th century as one of
                    the five Indian ports he had seen during the course of his twenty-four-year travels.
                    Desinganadu's rajas exchanged embassies with Chinese rulers while there was a flourishing Chinese
                    settlement at Kollam. In the 9th Century, on his way to Canton, China, Persian merchant Sulaiman
                    al-Tajir found Kollam to be the only port in India visited by huge Chinese junks. Marco Polo, the
                    Venetian traveller, who was in Chinese service under Kublai Khan in 1275, visited Kollam and other
                    towns on the west coast, in his capacity as a Chinese mandarin. Kollam is also home to one of the
                    seven churches that were established by St Thomas.

                            <p class="card-text">The incredible beauty of Kerala, Ashtamudi lake has eight branches
                                that coincide with the Arabian sea after converging into one channel, hence the name
                                Ashtamudi, where Ashta means eight and mudi means branch.

                                Spell-binding the travelers with its inarticulate and persuasive charm, this second
                                largest lake in Kerala is one of the most popular places to visit in Kollam.
                                Beautifying the banks of this lake, palm and coconut trees, intensifies the
                                fascinating experience of calm and lush green waterways.

                            <p class="card-text">Climb up the 200 steps to enjoy the panoramic view of the Arabian
                                sea and Kollam. Mounting grandly above the coconut trees, Tangasseri Lighthouse is
                                the second tallest lighthouse with a height of 140 feet on the coast of Kerala.

                                The red and white painted bands around the lighthouse make it marvelous and
                                dignified. Moreover, witnessing the pleasant sunset from the top of the lighthouse
                                is a breathtaking experience. Attracting tourists towards its enchanting beauty and
                                calming view, an evening to the lighthouse is worth visiting among places to see in
                                Kollam.
