                    Ernakulam About this soundpronunciation (help·info), is a portion of the city
                    of Kochi in central
                    Kerala, India and has lent its name to the Ernakulam district.The Kerala High Court, the office of
                    the Kochi Municipal Corporation and the Cochin Stock Exchange are situated here. Ernakulam is known
                    as
                    the commercial capital of Kerala. The Ernakulam Junction is a major railway station of the Indian
                    Railways. Initially, Ernakulam was the headquarters of the Ernakulam District but was later shifted
                    to
                    Kakkanad. Ernakulam was once the capital of the Kingdom of Cochin. It is located 220 kilometres (137
                    mi) north - west of the state capital Thiruvananthapuram. The city has served as an incubator for
                    many
                    Malayali entrepreneurs and is a major financial and commercial hub of Kerala.

                    The state government and the GCDA have plans to include Angamaly, Perumbavoor, Piravom and
                    Kolenchery
                    in the Ernakulam district; Mala and Kodungallur in the Thrissur district; Thalayolaparambu and
                    Vaikom
                    in Kottayam; and Cherthala in the Alappuzha district within the Kochi metropolitan limits. The newly
                    formed metropolis would be put under the charge of a new authority called Kochi Metropolitan
                    Regional
                    Development Authority.

                                village, located 4km of Pattanakkad. The tall lighthouse in white and red grabs
                                attention as it helps navigate the seamen at night. The Andhakaranazhi Beach happens
                                to be a site for frequent shooting for Malayalam films, thus drawing more attention
                                from the locals.
